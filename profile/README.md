## STORY

**Ryuji Hirasaka.** A depraved doctor with severe personality issues. Despite his genius, he has no interest in anything but humiliating and toying with other people, whom he views as nothing more than subjects to use for his experiments.

One day, Hirasaka receives a request to work on a temporary basis at **St. Juliana Hospital**. Waiting there for him is one of his former victims—**Narumi Jinguji**.

Narumi makes Hirasaka an unexpected proposal. Her goal is to create the world's most corrupt hospital ward, and she wants Hirasaka’s help to mold the perfect staff for it.

Hirasaka finds himself perplexed by such an extraordinary proposal. However, the chance to finally realize his twisted ambitions is a temptation he cannot resist. Will St. Juliana Hospital become a den of mad science, or will Hirasaka's incompetence and unlikability spell the end for the Night Shift before it even begins?

## CHARACTERS

### Ren Nanase *(Voice: Kaname Shirotsuki)*
One of Hirasaka’s new charges, and a candidate to become a nurse on the special ward.

To Hirasaka, she is the perfect test subject. Her looks and her devoted approach to patient care make her the epitome of an "angel in white."

Upon first meeting Hirasaka, Ren's straightforward personality leads her to treat him with sincerity and respect rather than avoid him.

---

### Ako Fujisawa *(Voice: Nagomi Naruse)*
One of the candidates to become a nurse on the special ward.

A mild-mannered woman, she evokes the image of a sheltered beauty with a somehow otherworldly quality about her. Her quiet personality seems to act against her, and she often gets teased.

Ako appears to be aware of this aspect of herself too.

---

### Hikaru Kodama *(Voice: Haruto Tsuruya)*
One of the candidates to become a nurse on the special ward.

Extremely energetic, she could be sympathetically described as naïve. A less generous assessment might be that she is mentally immature, without a hint of womanly charm or composure.

However, when with her patients, Hikaru shows herself to be an extremely devoted and tolerant nurse, winning her a great deal of trust. She’s feisty too, and doesn’t hesitate to let Hirasaka know exactly what she thinks of him.

---

### Remi Shinjo *(Voice: Kanna Natsuki)*
One of the candidates to become a nurse in the special ward.

A clean freak and a perfectionist, she is hard on both herself and others in her role as nurse supervisor. While herself brilliant, she is just as intolerant of her subordinates' mistakes as her beautiful yet severe appearance suggests.

Although this talented queen bee tends toward a prideful and confrontational manner, she shows a fragile, delicate side when her own failings are pointed out.

---

### Makoto Karino *(Voice: Mako Ayane)*
A patient, admitted after being involved in a car accident. Currently receiving rehabilitation for the aftereffects of the crash.

The daughter of the head surgeon, her selfish behavior causes those around her to see her as a nuisance. Her arrogant personality leads her to treat Hirasaka as a piece of trash from the get-go.

---

### Narumi Jinguji *(Voice: Mashiro Kazahana)*
One of the most influential people at the hospital, she is the one to suggest the plan that kicks off our story.

While both talented and beautiful, her true intentions remain shrouded in mystery. Why would she propose this plan in spite of the fact she has been on the receiving end of Hirasaka's evil ways in the past? What led her to go out of her way to invite the very object of her hatred to work with her?

None see beyond her bewitching mask to the truth that lies hidden within.
